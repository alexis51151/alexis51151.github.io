**Important**: I am looking for job opportunities starting in 2026. Reach out to me!

I am a fifth-year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.rice.edu) of Rice University advised by Prof. [Konstantinos Mamouras](https://kmamouras.github.io) (starting from Fall 2021).

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) and was a student of [Telecom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en) Engineeering School.

My research aims to provide better abstractions and software/hardware implementation of systems for processing semi-structured data and streams.
